# WERSI Drum Composer CX5 - User Manual

## PREFACE

This user manual is designed to help you learn about the many capabilities and applications of the WERSI Drum Composer CX 5. The many inscriptions on the control panel may initially confuse you, but don't worry: we will explain all the functions of your CX 5 in detail.

The first part of the manual covers the functions and possibilities of the basic configuration, while the second part introduces the additional capabilities and applications of the full configuration. Even if you purchased the CX 5 in the full configuration, you should first familiarize yourself with the basic version!

As you know, the capabilities of a computer system are determined by its software; this also applies to the CX 5. Please note that software changes may result in deviations from the functions described here. Now enjoy your WERSI Drum Composer CX 5!

## PREPARATIONS

Before you can get started, you must make the necessary connections and observe the following important safety measures.

### 1. Power Connection

**Check mains voltage:** The specification on the voltage selector next to the mains input must match your household mains voltage!

**Establish mains connection:** Insert the power cable into a properly installed Schuko socket.

**Note:** The power transformer is short-circuit protected by a thermal fuse and therefore requires no primary mains fuse.

Observe VDE regulations! Always unplug the power cable before opening the device!

If you transport your CX 5 to different locations, follow this tip:

**Note for cold weather:** Devices coming from cold environments fog up in warm rooms. This condensation is a normal physical process. Please wait for the device to dry before switching it on, as leakage currents could cause damage. First acclimatize, then play!

### 2. Audio Connection

The CX 5 has 2 audio connection options:

**Stereo Output:** Via the stereo jack socket "Stereo-Output," a two-channel sum signal can be taken out. Connect your amplifier or active speaker here, or a high-impedance stereo headphone (greater than 800 ohms).

**8-Channel Output:** For use with a mixing console, 8 separate channels are available via RCA connectors.

The 27 instruments of the CX 5 are distributed across the 8 channels:

| Channel | Instruments |
|---------|-------------|
| Chan. 1 | Bass Drums |
| Chan. 2 | Snares |
| Chan. 3 | Hi-Hats |
| Chan. 4 | Tom-Toms, Timpani |
| Chan. 5 | Cymbals |
| Chan. 6 | Bongos, Synthedrum |
| Chan. 7 | Tambourine, Brush, Thriller, Clap, "Hey," "Aha" |
| Chan. 8 | Cowbell, Crash Cymbal |

## BASIC CONFIGURATION

### Switching On

Switch on the device using the power switch located on the back of the device. The LEDs in the control panel buttons blink as a "start check." The display shows: "DRUMCOMPOSER CX 5" (The basic version has no display).

**Note:** Control panel buttons are numbered from top left = 1 to bottom right = 35.

### Selecting and Starting a Rhythm

Press any rhythm selection button 15-22 or 27-34. The start check is interrupted. Only the LEDs of the activated rhythm selection button and button 6 "F - RH 1" (= Fixed Rhythm Group 1) light up; the LED of the "START/STOP" button (35) blinks.

The display shows the rhythm name. Start the rhythm by pressing the "START/STOP" button (35). The symbol "▶" lights up on the right side of the display. The display shows the speed on the left in beats per minute (20-233 bpm).

The speed can be changed with the "Speed" slider. Use the "Volume" slider to set the desired volume. The "START/STOP" button blinks at the beginning of each measure (Down-Beat Indicator).

### Changing Rhythms

To change the rhythm, simply press one of the buttons 15-22 or 27-34. The new rhythm name appears in the display.

### Selector

The "Selector" button (Button 4) selects the rhythm group whose rhythms are assigned to the lower inscriptions of the rhythm selection buttons. You can access 32 rhythms of permanently installed Group 1 "F-RH 1" or 32 rhythms of Group 2 "F-RH 2" (Button 6).

The Selector allows you to choose between 2 rhythms per rhythm selection button, offering variations of the printed rhythms.

### Reset Function

Pressing the red reset switch on the back causes the CX 5 to end its current function and return to the initial state. Use this if you make an operating error.

### Tempomat

The CX 5 offers a standard tempo (ideal tempo) for each rhythm. Press "Tempomat" (Button 9) to activate it (LED lights up). Each rhythm will be played at a fixed tempo, and the "Speed" slider becomes non-functional.

Press "Tempomat" again (LED goes out) to adjust tempo with the "Speed" slider. For custom rhythms, you can set your ideal tempo as desired.

### Start/Stop/Intro/Break

Each programmed rhythm consists of two differently composed measures that repeat alternately. The "Down-Beat Indicator" signals the first beat of each measure.

"Start/Stop" always starts on the "one" of the first measure. Each programmed rhythm includes an Intro (introduction) and a Break (solo). Tap the "Intro/Break" button (23) briefly to trigger the intro, then the normal rhythm follows.

**During running rhythm:**
- **Brief tap** (less than 0.1 sec.): Solo at the next measure start
- **Long press:** Solo immediately

### Pitch

For all rhythms, you can change the programmed tuning:

1. Start the desired rhythm
2. Activate "Pitch" button (8) (LED lights up)
3. Use the "Speed" slider for tuning adjustment
4. Press "Pitch" again (LED goes out)

The new tuning applies to all selected rhythms. Press the slider to the middle position to restore normal tuning. The CX 5 automatically switches to normal tuning when powered off.

### Snare Roll

The "Snare Roll" function (Button 14) allows you to trigger a drum roll during a running rhythm.

### Sound Effects

The CX 5 in full configuration offers 6 sound effects:

**Group 1:**
- Crash Cymbal
- Thriller
- Clap

**Group 2:**
- Hey
- Aha
- Synthe Drum

Switch between groups with the "Effect Sel." button (12).

### Manual Rhythm

The CX 5 allows you to trigger 16 instruments directly by hand (Manual Rhythm):

Press "Man. Rh." (Button 13) (LED lights up). The rhythm selection buttons 15-22, 27-34 now function as instrument selection buttons.

Press "Man. Rh." again (LED goes out) to switch off Manual Rhythm. You can also start the previously selected rhythm directly with "START/STOP" without switching off "Man. Rh."
